    "### Creating New Training Data: Rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about the MNIST training data you realise that it is quite a rich set of examples of how people write numbers. There are all sorts of styles of handwriting in there, good and bad too.\n",
    "The neural network has to learn as many of these variations as possible. It does help that there are many forms of the number “4” in there. Some are squished, some are wide, some are rotated, some have an open top and some are closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wouldn’t it be useful if we could create yet more such variations as examples? How would we do that? We can’t easy collect thousands more examples of human handwriting. We could but it would be very laborious.\n",
    "A cool idea is to take the existing examples, and create new ones from those by rotating them clockwise and anticlockwise, by 10 degrees for example. For each training example we could have two additional examples. We could create many more examples with different rotation angles, but for now let’s just try $+10$ and $-10$ degrees to see if the idea works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s many extensions and libraries come to the rescue again. The *ndimage.interpolation.rotate()* can rotate an array by a given angle, which is exactly what we need. Remember that our inputs are a one-dimensional long list of length 784, because we’ve designed our neural networks to take a long list of input signals. We’ll need to reshape that long list into a $28*28$ array so we can rotate it, and then unroll the result back into a $784$ long list of input signals before we feed it to our neural network.\n",

    "It is worth noticing that for large angles the performance degrades. That makes sense, as large angles means we create images which don’t actually represent the numbers at all. Imagine a “3” on its side at 90 degrees. That’s not a three anymore. So by adding training examples with overly rotated images, we’re reducing the quality of the training by adding false examples. Ten degrees seems to be the optimal angle for maximising the value of additional data.\n",
    "The performance for 10 epochs peaks at a record breaking 0.9787 or almost 98%! That is really a stunning result, amongst the best for this kind of simple network. Remember we haven’t done any fancy tricks to the network or data that some people will do,we’ve kept it simple, and still achieved a result to be very proud of."
