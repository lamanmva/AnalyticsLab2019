We will use our convnet to classify MNIST digits, a task that you've already been \n","through in Chapter 2, using a densely-connected network (our test accuracy then was 97.8%). Even though our convnet will be very basic, its \n","accuracy will still blow out of the water that of the densely-connected model from Chapter 2.\n","\n","The 6 lines of code below show you what a basic convnet looks like.
